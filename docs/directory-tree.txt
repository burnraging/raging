Directory Tree
--------------

This explains what everything is and where it is.

(1) NUFR, RNET, Raging Utilities Distribution

    These are in the following dirs:

      ./source/*
      ./include/*

    The files in ./source/ and ./include/ won't change with a given raging release.
    There is only one copy of these files--all projects compile against the same
    copy.

    There are certain files that NUFR, by design, allows or requires there to be
    multiple copies of. The files are listed here:

       nufr-compile-switches.h
       nufr-platform.c/.h
       nufr-platform-app.c/.h
       nufr-platform-import.h
       nufr-platform-export.h
       nsvc-app.c/.h
       rnet-compile-switches.h
       rnet-app.c/.h

    Their location is explained later.
    These files are not and should not be placed in the ./source/ and ./include/
    distribution folders becaue NUFR--by design--allows and expects there to be
    multiple copies of these files. The files vary from one project to another.
    It is necessary that the compiled build include one copy of each of the above
    files.

(2) NUFR Platform folder (./nufr-platform/)

    The location ./nufr-platform/ is a repository for storing the project-specific
    NUFR and RNET files. There are multiple directories under ./nufr-platform/, and
    each child directory has a complete set of the project-specific files.

    Some child directories under ./nufr-platform/ are included with the distribution;
    the system engineer may choose to add to this his or her own child directories.

    The child directories are as follows:

        ./nufr-platform/pc-pthread/
             This is used by the pthread emulation which runs on the PC. Currently
             only the windows pthread emulation is used, but I don't see any reason
             why this directory couldn't be shared with a linux pthread emulation.

        ./nufr-platform/pc-ut/
             The PC windows UT environment uses these files. The linux UT environment
             could share these files also.

        ./nufr-platform/small-soc/
             Unlike ./pc-pthread/ and ./pc-ut/, which are intended for use in a
             pthread emulation or simulation environment, ./small-soc/ is intended
             for use in a native computing environment. A "native computing environment"
             is either actual hardware or QEMU emulation of the actual hardware.
             As its name suggests, ./small-soc/ has settings which are optimized for
             a small computing environment: 2-16k RAM.

             The current raging distribution has some ARM Cortex M-series port code
             in these files. There are plans to add the hooks for an MSP430 port;
             some code also exist for this.


(3) The platform folder (./platform/)

   Files which are CPU-specific are stored under ./platform. Files which are ARM Cortex
   M-Series or files which are MSP430 have their own subdirectories under ./platform:

      ./platform/ARM_CMx           ARM Cortex M-series specific
      ./platform/MSP_430           (TBD) MSP430 would go here
      ./platform/ARM_CMx/ARM_CM4   (TBD) ARM Cortex M4 specific. Files which must deviate from the
                                         ARM Cortex M-series version.
      ./platform/ARM_CMx/gcc       ARM Cortex M-series with gcc-specific files
                                   Since inline assembler is compiler-specific, this directory
                                   has gcc-type assembler
      ./platform/ARM_CMx/ARM_CM4/gcc (TBD) ARM Coretex M4 gcc-specific files. Replacement
                                     for ARM_CMx/gcc version.

    There is a master ARM Cortex M-series directory (ARM_CMx) which houses the ARM Cortex M0, M1,
    M2, M3, M4. Any functionality common to these CPUs (and not compiler-specificO) is
    placed in ./ARM_CMx/.

    Notice that there are limitations on these CPU-specific files. Some files are part or
    completely assembly language, and since assembly language syntax varies from compiler
    to compiler, there must be different versions of the same assembler for each
    compiler. Therefore, there is one folder per compiler vendor under each CPU-specific
    branch, and these folders have, essentially, the same content as another compiler
    vendor folder.

(4) The tests directories


(5) Examples directory (./examples/)

    Code which is showcased in NUFR manuals or which is given as an example of how to use
    NUFR in some way or which is under development for future raging releases in lumped into
    ./examples/.

(6) Documentation

    All documentation files are in ./docs/.
